Blaze
=====

The ultra high-performance JSON Schema validator for C++ with support for JSON
Schema Draft 4, Draft 6, Draft 7, 2019-09, and 2020-12. Built on top of the
powerful [JSON Toolkit](https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsontoolkit) library.

***

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are working hard to get Blaze to its first stable release. This includes:
>
> - Improving the documentation to include a basic getting started guide
> - Support running the validator on [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)
> - Bindings to higher-level programming languages, starting with Node.js
> - Publishing an academic paper along with a reproducible benchmark
> - Landing various other in-progress optimizations
>
> Please star the project to show us your support!

Features
--------

- **Performance:** Blaze compiles JSON Schema into a lower-level intermediate
  language for ultra fast evaluation. It can achieve schema validation in the
  nano-second range, making it a perfect fit for low-latency gateways and
  validation of large datasets

- **Compliance:** Blaze achieves a 100% compliance score in the official
  [Bowtie](https://bowtie.report/#/implementations/cpp-blaze) benchmark, while
  popular validators like [AJV](https://bowtie.report/#/implementations/js-ajv)
  only achieve an average 85% compliance. Furthermore, Blaze is built and
  maintained by a [JSON Schema TSC member](https://www.jviotti.com)

- **Extensibility:** Blaze supports the implementation of custom vocabularies
  of arbitrary complexity, and the ability to setup custom resolution of
  external schemas from arbitrary sources, like from HTTP, filesystem,
  databases, etc

- **Annotations:** Blaze is one of the few implementations that fully supports
  annotation extraction during evaluation to augment instances with semantic
  information, making it a great fit for data science scenarios

Example
-------

Blaze is designed to be easy to use, while at the same time providing extensive
hooks for supporting custom vocabularies, resolving external schemas, and more.

```cpp
// (1) Get a JSON Schema
const auto schema{sourcemeta::jsontoolkit::parse(R"JSON({
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "string"
})JSON")};

// (2) Compile the JSON Schema into an optimised representation
const auto compiled_schema{sourcemeta::blaze::compile(
  schema,

  // These options allow you tweak how Blaze works,
  // the JSON Schema vocabularies it understands,
  // and how to resolve references to external schemas
  sourcemeta::jsontoolkit::default_schema_walker,
  sourcemeta::jsontoolkit::official_resolver,
  sourcemeta::blaze::default_schema_compiler,

  // Fast validation means getting to a boolean result
  // as fast as possible. Check out the documentation
  // for how to get detailed error information and/or
  // collect JSON Schema annotations
  sourcemeta::blaze::Mode::FastValidation)};

// (3) Get a JSON instance
const sourcemeta::jsontoolkit::JSON instance{"Hello Blaze!"};

// (4) Validate the instance against the schema
const auto result{sourcemeta::blaze::evaluate(compiled_schema, instance)};
if (result) {
  std::cout << "Success!\n";
}
```
